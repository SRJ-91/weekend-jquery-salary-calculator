## Description

Your project description goes here. What problem did you solve? How did you solve it?

This project is designed to track employees by their names, ID, title, and annual salary. It also tracks the companies monthly salary expenses. 

To complete this project I had to learn about table elements and refine my knowledge of click handlers, event targeting, and appending vs inputting text. 

I learned about how back ticks can be necessary to separate heavy syntax lines. 

I used (alert) and (return false) to stop functions for the first time. When implementing my if statement to alert and halt the submit button should all fields not be filled in - it broke my project until I realized it was a code flow/order problem. It had to be positioned at the right time in the code block to catch the initialization before the table row was actually appended.

I solved issues with the help of Google and my classmates. About 50/50.
